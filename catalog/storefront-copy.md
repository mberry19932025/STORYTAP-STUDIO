The TShirt Comedian

## One-liner (short bio)

OffendHop political humor apparel. You Will Be Offended. Satire only.

## About (medium)

The TShirt Comedian is the storefront for OffendHop: punchline-forward tees, hoodies, hats, and crewnecks built to get a laugh before you even touch the mic. Our designs lean controversial (not cruel): jokes aimed at ideas, systems, and public behavior—never slurs, threats, or harassment.

Not affiliated with Facebook or any political campaign.
